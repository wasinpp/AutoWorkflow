# [TODO] 
- Snap-shot test
- [CI] Run test only in changed module: https://itnext.io/gradle-modules-running-unit-tests-only-in-affected-modules-fff89562339e

# [InProgress]
- Integrate with pagination-compose

# Monitoring: App Launch time
Concept:
- Use Kotlin IR to hook and print out the start, end-time. 
- Then use the plugin to capture the diff time.
- Compare with the some metric and report through github comment or slack message.

Open question: 
- How to handler swing result. 
  Is jetpack benchmark help us by isolating each target and run benchmark against them.
  
Tech stack: 
IR hook, Jetpack benchmark, FTL, Kotlin Script

Measure Level:
- App.onCreate() -> First Activity
- Activity Start -> Render to user (For each activity)

Tasks: 
- [TODO] All script use kotlin script
- [TODO] Use Plugin build (Composite build). The related logic should not increase local build time of main project. 
  So, it should only run on CI environment.
- [TODO] Run with FTL, so may need FTL Plugin too
- [TODO] Report exceed threshold
