## Run backend
Currently, there is only one backend module, :backend:shopping
1) Run backend on android studio:
    - Disable Android studio's feature: do not build gradle task list during sync
    - Should be run on command line: ./gradlew  backend:shopping:run. Otherwise, might face some missing classdef error.
2) Should backend on intellij. Run it on AndroidStudio need to be run on command line
    - Lower the android-gradle plugin version to 7.0.4
    - Click run button on ApplicationKt.main
    - AutoReload: ./gradlew -t backend:shopping:build -x test -i
